# Bash script to perform a two-stage join and a final annotation step.
# 1. Processes a PSL file to filter, clean, and reformat columns. It specifically
#    parses the Q_name to extract a clean gene identifier for joining.
# 2. Joins the result with a CSV data file based on a composite key (GeneID, TranscriptID),
#    appending the 'Probability_Functional' column.
# 3. Annotates the result from step 2 by looking up the parsed gene ID in a third file
#    and appending the specific essentiality status found.
#
# Usage: ./modified_join_script.sh <original.psl> <data.csv> <essentials.csv> > final_output.csv
